=========

Hover box is a component that adds a color-changing box to your website. When the user
hovers over the box, it will change from blue to red.

To implement, simply add the component to vendor/_index.sass

    // In vendor/_index.sass

    @import hover-box/component

Use the `hover-box` mixin:

  .myhoverbox
    +hover-box
